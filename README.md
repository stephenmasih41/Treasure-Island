# 🏝️ Treasure Island Game – Python Adventure Game

### 🎯 Project: Day 3 Project – Treasure Island  
> *(Actually my 4th day of learning Python 😄)*

---

## 📚 What I Learned

Today I learned all about **conditionals in Python** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and how to use them to control the flow of a program based on user input. This was an exciting way to practice logical thinking and branching paths in code! 💡

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

This is a fun little text-based adventure game where your mission is simple:  
**Find the hidden treasure!** 💰

But beware... one wrong move and it's **Game Over**! 💀

### 🧭 Game Flow:
1. You're at a crossroad:  
   → Type `"left"` or `"right"`
2. If you go left, you reach a lake:  
   → Type `"wait"` for a boat or `"swim"` across
3. If you wait and reach the island:  
   → Choose a door: `"red"`, `"yellow"`, or `"blue"`

Each choice leads to a different outcome. Only one path leads to victory! 🏆

## 🧠 Concepts Used:
- `input()` function
- `.lower()` to handle case-insensitive inputs
- Multi-level `if`-`elif`-`else` statements
- ASCII art for immersive experience 🎨

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python 3

---

## 🚀 Run the Game

Just copy and paste the code into your Python environment (like Replit, VS Code, or a terminal) and enjoy the adventure! 🎮

## 🔚 Outcome:
This project helped reinforce my understanding of conditionals and nested logic structures. Can’t wait for more Python fun tomorrow! 🐍✨
